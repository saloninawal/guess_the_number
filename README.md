This code defines a simple number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback whether the guess is too high or too low, and the player continues guessing until they guess the correct number. Once the correct number is guessed, the program congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts it took.
